/**
 * The server side of the Mats Eager Cache system - sitting on the "data owner" source data side. This server will
 * listen for requests for cache updates, and send out a serialization of the source data to the clients, which will
 * deserialize it and make it available. The server will also schedule full updates to be sent out on a regular basis,
 * to ensure that the clients are kept up to date. There's optionally also a feature for sending partial updates, which
 * can be employed if the source data is frequently updated in a way that makes full updates too resource intensive.
 * <p>
 * It is expected that the source data is either held in memory (backed by a database), or read directly from a database
 * or other external source. If held in memory, the source data is also effectively a cache of the database, which leads
 * to a few interesting aspects: As always with systems employing Mats3, it is expected that the source service (the
 * data owner) have multiple instances running, to ensure high availability and scalability. However, events updating
 * the source data will often come in on a single instance (e.g. via a GUI, or via REST), and this instance will then
 * somehow need to propagate the update to the other instances. Typically, the update is first stored to the database by
 * the event receiver, whereupon it should tell all instances to update their view of the source data. The Mats Eager
 * Cache system have a feature for this, where you can send "command messages" to all the siblings via the
 * {@link #sendSiblingCommand(String, String, byte[]) sendSiblingCommand(..)} method and the corresponding
 * {@link #addSiblingCommandListener(Consumer) addSiblingCommandListener(..)} method. All instances - including the
 * originator - will then receive the command, and can either refresh the source data from database, or apply the update
 * directly to the source data. It is beneficial if the originator also employs this event to update its version of the
 * source data, to ensure consistency between the nodes. A boolean will tell whether the command originated on this
 * instance - the one that originated (=<code>true</code>) will then propagate the update to the MatsEagerCache via
 * {@link #scheduleBroadcastFullUpdate()} or {@link #broadcastPartialUpdate(CacheSourceDataCallback)}.
 * <p>
 * The source data is accessed by the cache server via the {@link CacheSourceDataCallback} supplier provided in the
 * constructor. It is important that the source data can be read in a consistent manner, so some kind of synchronization
 * or locking of the source data should be employed while the cache server reads it (mainly relevant if the source data
 * is held in memory).

     * This is an optional functionality to conserve resources for situations where somewhat frequent partial updates is

     * with stale data.
     * <p>
     * Correctly applying a partial update on the client can be more complex than consuming a full update, as the client
     * must merge the partial update into the existing data structures, taking care to overwrite where appropriate, but
     * insert if the entity is new. This is why the feature is optional, and should only be used if the source data is

     * <p>
     * If the cache server is currently in the process of sending a full or partial update, this method will be held
     * until current update is finished - there is an exclusive lock around sending updates. It is also important to let
     * the stream of partial data returned from {@link CacheSourceDataCallback#provideSourceData(Consumer)} read
     * directly from the source data structures, and not from some temporary not-applied representation, as otherwise
     * the partial update might send out data that is older than what is currently present and which might have already
     * been sent via a concurrent update (think about races here). Thus, always first apply the update to the source
     * data in some atomic fashion, and then retrieve the partial update from the source data, also in an atomic fashion
     * (e.g. use synchronization or locking).
     * <p>
     * It is advisable to not send a lot of partial updates in a short time span, as this will result in memory churn
     * and higher memory usage on the clients due to message reception and partial update merge. Rather coalesce the
     * partial updates into a single update, or use a waiting mechanism until the source data has stabilized before
     * sending out a partial update - or just send a full update.
     * <p>
     * Also, if the partial update is of a substantial part of the data, it is advisable to send a full update instead -
     * this can actually give lower peak memory load on the clients, as they can then just throw away the old data
     * before updating with the new data.
     * <p>
