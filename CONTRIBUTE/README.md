# Contributing to Mats

## Stølsvik Contributor Agreement

To contribute to the Mats project, the *Stølsvik Contributor Agreement* ("SCA") must be signed and mailed back to me, Endre Stølsvik. *(This is an agreement based on the Oracle Contributor Agreement ("OCA") for e.g. contributing to the JDK, modified slightly.)*

The SCA gives Endre and the contributor joint copyright in the contribution. The contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to Endre. The contributor may still choose to do whatever with the contribution, and so can Endre.

Procedure for submitting the SCA:
1. Download the SCA here: [Stølsvik Contributor Agreement](Stølsvik%20Contributor%20Agreement,%20v1.pdf)
2. Print it
3. Fill in and sign the form (section 7), remembering to put one 'X' on one of the options (individual or entity)
4. Scan the paper
5. Send it via email to endre@stolsvik.com

If submitting on behalf of a company, please also describe in the same email who in the company that are authorized to contribute.

## Submitting code or other material

After having signed the SCA, submit a pull request, and in the git commit message write *"I contribute this material in accordance with the signed SCA."* if an individual, or if you are authorized to do so from a company, *"I contribute this material in accordance with {Companyname}'s signed SCA."*. Do include this line in every pull request, but you do not need to submit a new SCA.

Thanks!
